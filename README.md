# 🌟 Stellar Spectra Analysis

🔭 Analysis of 2 target stars using 28 reference spectra covering spectral types O4–M4 (wavelength 3900–5000 Å).  
⚙️ Python tools: Astropy, Specutils, Matplotlib, NumPy used for reading, normalizing, comparing, and classifying stellar spectra.  
📊 The project generates visualizations of spectral features, highlights key differences, and allows classification of target stars against the reference set.  
📝 Data and code are organized for reproducibility, including reference and target spectra, scripts, and figures.  
👥 Authors: Gonzalo Marrero, Pablo Jiménez, Nöel Cortés.
